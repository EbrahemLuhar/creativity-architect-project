# creativity architect project

## About the project

The Creativity Architect website was made to display the work the company has done and provides a blog of recent projects. The logo was also custom made and the colour scheme of the website was made to complement the logo.

The project was built using HTML CSS and Javascript. It is fully responsive and includes my first attempt at making
a mobile navigation menu.

## What I Learned

I learned more about using CSS Flexbox and Grid to position elements and arrange them to be mobile responsive.
Making the mobile navigation imporoved my ability to manipulate the DOM using javascript. Started using some CSS
animations to create user interactivity and make certain parts of the website stand out.
